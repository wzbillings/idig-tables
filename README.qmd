## Reproducibility

To run the code in this repository you should do the following steps.

1. Install `R`, `Quarto`, and (optionally) `RStudio`.
	* `R` version at time of writing: `r version$version.string`.
	* `Rstudio` version at time of writing: 2023.12.0.369.
	* `Quarto` version at time of writing: `r quarto::quarto_version()`.
	* Complete `R` session information can be found in
	[`session-info.txt`](session-info.txt).
2. Install `renv` (version `r packageVersion("renv")` at time of writing).
3. Open `idig-tables.Rproj` in RStudio. The `renv` package should give you
instructions for continuing. Run `renv::restore()` to download and install the
package versions I used for making this presentation.
4. You should then be able to run/render any `R` code or quarto documents
in this repository.
