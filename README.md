## Reproducibility

To run the code in this repository you should do the following steps.

1.  Install `R`, `Quarto`, and (optionally) `RStudio`.
    - `R` version at time of writing: R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31 ucrt).
    - `Rstudio` version at time of writing: 2023.12.0.369.
    - `Quarto` version at time of writing: 1.3.340.
    - Complete `R` session information can be found in
      [`session-info.txt`](session-info.txt).
2.  Install `renv` (version 1.0.3 at time of writing).
3.  Open `idig-tables.Rproj` in RStudio. The `renv` package should give
    you instructions for continuing. Run `renv::restore()` to download
    and install the package versions I used for making this
    presentation.
4.  You should then be able to run/render any `R` code or quarto
    documents in this repository.
